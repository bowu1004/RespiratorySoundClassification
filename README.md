# Respiratory Sound Classification

### Various features of respiratory sounds contribute to the categorical representations in different extent, e.g. the tonal centroid, spectral contrast, chromagram, Mel-frequency spectrogram, Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, and short-term Fourier transform. We propose the use of deep learning methods (i.e. convolutional neural networks) to discover the efficacy and efficiency of potential multiple features for respiratory sound classification. This may help develop novel data-driven models for COVID-19 preliminary screening during this pandemic. The studied multiple features of respiratory sounds may also fill the gaps between clinical data and screening methods.
